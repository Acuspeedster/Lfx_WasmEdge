# Rust IDE with LLM Integration 🚀

An intelligent IDE that automates the creation and maintenance of Rust projects using Large Language Model (LLM) technology. Powered by the Qwen2.5 Coder 7b model for smart code generation and automatic error correction.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Automatically generates Rust projects based on natural language descriptions.
- 🔄 **Automated Error Fixing**: Integrates seamlessly with the Rust compiler to identify and fix errors automatically.
- 📁 **Project Structuring**: Creates an organized Cargo project structure with all essential files.
- 💾 **Context Persistence**: Uses MongoDB to maintain conversation context for improved iterative code generation.
- ⚡ **Real-time Compilation**: Receive immediate feedback with integrated Rust compiler support.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language Model**: Qwen2.5 Coder 7b (AI model for code generation and error correction)
- **Backend**: Python 3.7+
- **Database**: MongoDB (for context persistence and project data)
- **Compiler**: Rust (compiles the generated code)
- **API Integration**: OpenRouter AI (for AI-based code generation)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7** or higher
- **Rust and Cargo** toolchain
- **MongoDB instance** (for context persistence)
- **OpenRouter AI API Key** (for AI-powered code generation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

## ⚠️ Limitations
Complex project generation may require multiple iterations for optimal results.
Performance depends on the LLM's response quality.
An active internet connection is required for API calls.
