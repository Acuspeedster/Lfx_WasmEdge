# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Example in Rust

This project demonstrates an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Rust. The implementation includes error handling, async/await patterns, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- Custom error handling using `thiserror`
- Async support using `tokio`
- Integration and unit testing
- Modular code structure

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `cargo build`
3. Run tests with `cargo test`
4. Run the program with `cargo run`

## Example Usage

The program performs a BFS on a sample graph structure starting from node 0. The graph is represented as an adjacency list. The output shows the nodes visited at each level.

Learn more about the implementation in the [documentation](https://docs.rs/bfs_example).

This project demonstrates Rust's capabilities in:
- Error handling with custom error types
- Async/await programming using Tokio
- Testing strategies
- Modular programming with visibility control
- Documentation practices

The project is well-structured, maintains Rust idioms, and includes proper error handling while implementing a common algorithm like BFS.
